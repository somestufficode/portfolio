        Hello! I'm a perpetual creative spirit constantly in pursuit of my next canvas for expressing myself. From painting and crafting music to coding and writing, I find joy in every medium as they offer a cathartic release. Though I initially pursued actuarial science in college due to my mathematical knack and passion for problem-solving, a personal hiatus led me to discover a fresh journey in software engineering. This newfound path reignites a childhood desire to create. Without the act of creating, I feel incomplete.
